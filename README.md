# AccuWeather
A python library to interact with the accuweather api.

## General information
For now, there is only basic functionality included in this package.
However, I hope to add more features in the future.

The functionality that makes this package unique is the integration of the
location client within the weather client. Specifying location by city name (and country optionally) is a more userfriendly way to interact with the api.

## Before you start
You need to create an api token on the AccuWeather website (https://developer.accuweather.com).
